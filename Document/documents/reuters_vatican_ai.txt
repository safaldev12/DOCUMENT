VATICAN CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Vatican called for governments to keep a close eye on the development of artificial intelligence, warning the technology contained 'the shadow of evil' in its ability to spread misinformation. 'AI generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society,' the Vatican's document said. The text, titled 'Antica et nova', considered the impacts of AI in labour, healthcare and education and urged careful regulation.
