March 21 (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday unanimously adopted the first global resolution on artificial intelligence that encourages countries to safeguard human rights, protect personal data, and monitor AI for risks. The nonbinding resolution, proposed by the United States and co-sponsored by China and over 120 other nations, also advocates the strengthening of privacy policies. 'Today, all 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly have spoken in one voice,' U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. The measure warns the improper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of AI systems could undercut human rights and freedoms.
